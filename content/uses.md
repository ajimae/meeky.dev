Wondering what I use for development

Wonder no more!

Here is a list of all the fun things that I use on a daily basis.

# Editor + Terminal

- Visual Studio Code is my current Editor
  - I use a lot of VSCode plugins. [See the full list here.]()
  - Themes are [Bracket Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ullissescastro.theme-bracketslight), [Bracket Light Pro](https://github.com/EryouHao/brackets-light-pro)
- Using [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro): `Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace`
- [Bash](https://opensource.com/resources/what-bash) and [ITerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) are my terminals, but I mostly use Bash.
<!-- - I use a pretty vanilla installation of [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for additional terminal functionality -->

# Recording

- I use the built in Mac Quicktime Player to record my screen
- I use a Sony a6400 to record myself
- I use a [Shure VP83 LensHopper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DU66WWQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to capture the audio directly into the camera
- And because the Sony camera doesn 't support a monitor and an external mic at the same time I use a [Microphone Stand Extension Plate](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P8JSV1G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- I put it all on a [Joby GorillaPod](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003II3FD0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- I take the two recordings and edit them with [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)
-->

# Desk Setup

- My computer is a 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019, 2.6 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, 32 GB 2667 MHz DDR4)
- I have a 27 inch UHD [Dell](https://www.dell.com/ae/business/p/dell-u2717d-monitor/pd) monitor.
<!-- - I have an external Apple Keyboard and external Apple Touchpad -->

# Video Tour

I recorded a fun video showcasing my recording setup. It's from October 2019 so may be a little outdated, but hopefully you find it useful!
